                Making Open and Machine Readable the New Default for Government Information.

            <ul>
                <li>50% of data has IP address (in other words is online)!</li>
                <li>By 2020, almost all data will be connected.</li>
                <li>The abundance and ubiquitousness of data changes business intelligence models (e.g. think
                    Encyclopedia Britannica rendered obsolete by Wikipedia).
                </li>
                <li>We literally have a whole world in our pocket.</li>
                <li>We no longer choose to be connected, but not to be.</li>
                <li>Some companies accumulated lots of data over years, in a sense they sit on a pile of gold.</li>
                <li><i>Data is our most valuable natural resource.</i></li>
                <li><i>But, we need to be able to connect the dots.</i></li>

            <p>Tolkien's The Lord of the Rings trilogy has $ 788 $ pages ($ 311 + 258 + 219 $) totalling to $ 2.5 $ MB of raw text.</p>
            $$ \frac{20 PB}{2.5 MB} = \frac{2^{50}}{2^{20}} = 2^{30} \approx 10^9 $$
            <p><i>Google analyses an equivalent of 1 billion of LoTR trilogies every day!</i></p>

            <p>How data scientist title come to be:</p>
            <blockquote style="font-size: .75em;">
                “Business analyst” seemed too limiting. “Data analyst” was a contender, but we felt that title might
                limit what people could do. After all, many of the people on our teams had deep engineering expertise.
                “Research scientist” was a reasonable job title used by companies like Sun, HP, Xerox, Yahoo, and IBM.
                However, we felt that most research scientists worked on projects that were futuristic and abstract,
                and the work was done in labs that were isolated from the product development teams. It might take years
                for lab research to affect key products, if it ever did. Instead, the focus of our teams was to work on
                data applications that would have an immediate and massive impact on the business. The term that seemed
                to fit best was <i>data scientist: those who use both data and science to create something new</i>.

            <blockquote>
                [..] a data scientist is a predictive analytics professional who uses statistics and
                predictive modeling to solve business problems, and who has experience with tools for organizing
                unstructured, often streaming Big Data. They can work with a wide variety of data, as they have the
                skills to build their own utilities to acquire and clean it, and don’t rely on out-of-the-box solutions to
                structure their data.

            <blockquote style="width: 100%; font-size: .7em;">
                One salutary incident that I recall concerned a British mathematical physicist and an American
                theoretical physicist, Dr. Charles Kittel, who had been set together, side by side, to work on
                the problem of deducing the characteristics of German magnetic mines laid at sea, especially
                the sensitivity and polarity of the firing mechanism. The data from which the characteristics were
                to be deduced were the reports of our minesweepers as they exploded the mines, with the positions of
                the explosions being reported as ranges and bearings from the minesweepers. The first thing that Kittel
                wanted to do was to take a few trips on a minesweeper to sample the data for himself. The British
                theorist refused to do this, on the argument that he could only make a few trips, and therefore any
                experience so gained might be heavily biased, and therefore much too dangerous as a basis for
                generalization. So he stuck to his desk while Kittel went out minesweeping. What Kittel immediately
                found was that the reports from the minesweeping crews were wildly inaccurate as regards both range and
                bearing, and the only item of data on which one could rely was whether the mine had exploded to port or
                starboard. Simplifying all the later reports down to this extremely limited observation, he nevertheless
                succeeded in deducing the answer; but the British theorist went on accepting the data as accurate and
                never reached an answer.

This judgment certainly seemed reasonable, since the planes themselves seldom malfunctioned. [..] piloting skills were not the cause of the problem. If it wasn't human or mechanical error, what was it? [..] officials turned their attention to the design of the cockpit itself. [..] when the army was designing its first-ever cockpit, engineers had measured the physical dimensions of hundreds of pilots, and used this data to standardize the dimensions of the cockpit. [..]  In 1950, [..] measured more than 4,000 pilots on 140 dimensions of size [..] and calculated the average for each of these dimensions. [..] the consensus among fellow air force researchers was that the vast majority of pilots would be within the average range on most dimensions. After all, these pilots had already been pre-selected because they appeared to be average sized. [..] The scientists also expected that a sizable number of pilots would be within the average range on all 10 dimensions. But even Daniels was stunned when he tabulated the actual number.

            <p>Statistical graphics are instruments to help people reason about quantitive information.</p>
            <p>Often the most effective way to describe, explore, and summarize a set of numbers - even a very large set - is to look at pictures of those numbers.</p>
            <p>Of all methods for analyzing and communicating statistical information, well-designed data graphics are usually the simplest and at the same time the most powerful.</p>
            <p>Human eye have amazing ability to extract a lot of information from a small area (example on the next slide).</p>
            <p>So, how to visualize statistical information?</p>

            <p>Graphics need to make data clearer. Shape data to lead observer to conclusion.</p>

            $$
            \begin{equation}
            \begin{split}
            \mbox{lie factor} &= \frac{\mbox{size of effect shown in graphic}}{\mbox{size of effect in data}}
            \end{split}
            \end{equation}
            $$

            <p>Lie factor within $ [0.95, 1.05] $ is acceptable, beyond that means that data is misleading.</p>

            <p>Can also define $ log LF $, where $ log LF < 0 $ means that data is underrepresented  and $ log LF > 0 $ means that is overrepresented.</p>

            <p>Dimensionality expansion (e.g. showing stock price of crude oil in 3D barrels: 1D -> 3D) leads to $ LF $ explosion due to power factor.</p>

            <p>Here, the problem is too strong emphasis on design variation, without regard for reflecting the actual data variation.</p>

            <p>The confounding of design variation with data variation over the surface of graphic leads to ambiguity and deception.</p>

            <p>Reflect data dimensionality and do not inflate the dimensions (design dimensionality should be less or same as data dimensionality).</p>

            <i>Show data variation, not design variation</i>

            <p>However, it generally is a good idea to introduce other design variation (e.g. depth, shade, number instead of point, etc.) to represent data dimensions with less design dimensions.</p>

            <p>Money value changes over time with inflation, but also can be influenced by factors such as time-value of money. Simply plotting nominal value over time is going to lead to terribly bad conclusions.</p>

            <p><i>Data-ink</i> is the non-erasable core of a graphic, the non-redundant ink arrange in response to variation in the numbers represented.</p>

            $$
            \begin{equation}
            \begin{split}
            \mbox{Data-ink ratio} &= \frac{\mbox{data-ink}}{\mbox{total ink used to print the graphic}} \\

            <h4>Some ink saving can be found where you do not expect it</h4>
            <p>Example, symmetry. When analyzing faces, wases, and other naturally symmetrical objects, people examine only one side and if other is symmetric then once quickly established they stop analysing of the other half.</p>
            <p>Hence, we can save half-the-ink by dividing along the symmetry. At the same time, if there is asymmetry giving clear message of that by drawing both halves.</p>

            <h3>Data duplication in good faith</h3>
            <p>Sometimes it makes sense to duplicate data to reduce cognitive burden. For example, in some maps it is good to duplicate part of map on both edges allowing to read it without jumping between the two opposite sides.</p>
            <p>Hence, even we increase non-data ink, we improve data readability.</p>

                With one dimension marching along the regular rhythm of seconds, minutes, hours, days, weeks, months, years, centuries, or millennia, the natural ordering of the time scale gives this design a strength and efficiency o interpretation found in no other graphic arrangement.

            Computers are learning to think, read, and write. They're also picking up human sensory function, with the ability to see and hear (arguably to touch, taste, and smell, though those have been of a lesser focus). Machine intelligence technologies cut across a vast array of problem types (from classification and clustering to natural language processing and computer vision) and methods (from support vector machines to deep belief networks).

They have massive datasets and constant consumer interactions that enable tight feedback loops for their algorithms (and these factors combine to create powerful network effects) — and they have the most to gain from the low hanging fruit that machine intelligence bears.

            <p>How to verify that the model actually makes good predictions?</p>

            <p>Partition set into training and validation sets, then train the model using training set, and use validation as unseen data.</p>

            <p>10-fold cross-validation - divide data into 10 equally sized buckets; at each step train model using data from 9 buckets and verify using the remaining one, iterate 10 times, every time using different bucket for validation; measure validation score. Enables us to arrive at good confidence level with less data.</p>

            <h3>Mistakes to avoid</h3>

            <p>Confusing prediction and casual model - do two variables occur together and are influence by something else? Avoid variables that already indicate predicition result, e.g. session end timestamp in predicting how long typical user session lasts (we will not even have that data unless the session ends, so bad estimator).</p>

            <p>Seeing causation where there is none. Well trained algorithm should make good predictions for environment it seen, so the more stable our environment the more valuable our predictions. However, if we move algorithm to new environment we may not get good predictions it is one of human biases - we try to find patterns and causation everywhere.</p>

            <h3>Types of data science tools</h3>
            <p>Data science tools naturally divide into two categories among several dimensions, such as open and close source, or visual and coded.</p>
            <p>Most often, visual and closed source tools have advantage when it comes to non-technical users, e.g. Tableau. However, there are platform solutions such as Google's BigQuery (e.g. used by Spotify to make songs recommendations and match adverbs for free users) and complete solutions (from infastructure up to dashboard).</p>
            <p>However, the problem with the closed source is a glass ceiling. What it does it does very well, but once you want to do something out of intended use you often are out of luck. This sometimes can poses serious limitation.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h3>Types of data science tools</h3>
            <p>However, open source and programming heavy tools will give you the power you need. There is going to be initial inertia with setting up the environment (infrastructure, platform, visualisations, etc.), but once done, a lot of parts are going to be reusable.</p>
            <p>Imporatntly, this set-up allows for ownership of the solution and even automated data-driven decision making, e.g. once you model link prediction you can develop optimised model and deploy it to suggest friends on YourBook.com.</p>

            <h3>Types of data science tools</h3>
            <p>Open source tools were long time developed by many cutting-edge companies such as Google, Yahoo, Continuum, and big open source community that they easily match advanced closed source software capabilities and often exceed them giving the incredible flexibility and documentation.</p>

            <h3>Lingua Franca</h3>
            <p>Python and R are most commonly used programming languages for data scientific programming. Both have their pros and cons, but recently, thanks to years of scientific community contribution and plugins into other frameworks, Python emerged as both dominant and glue language of data science, while R and SAS are becoming less popular at scale.</p>
            <p>R still very useful, but only Python gives you ability to build everything from platform, via optimised code, up to dashboards in one language.</p>

            <h3>Python - a glue language</h3>
            <p>Python is a great language to work with data because mathematical formulas and algorithms can be developed almost at literal translation and pseudo-code levels. But, at the same time we have access to enormous amount of libraries and frameworks allowing us to concentrate on the problem at hand.</p>
            <p>Further to that, Python is fully portable, have bindings to many other popular frameworks and libraries (e.g. PySpark binding to Apache Spark), and can be very efficient (plain Python $ \rightarrow $ NumPy $ \rightarrow $ Cython / PyPy, ...) .</p>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h3>Continuum Analytics</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><a href="https://www.continuum.io/anaconda">Anaconda</a> is the fastest growing open data science platform with <a href="https://docs.continuum.io/anaconda/pkg-docs">$ > 400 $ of the most popular Python packages</a> for science, math, engineering, and data analysis, including Pandas, NumPy, and scikit-learn amongst many others. There is also even more powerful version of Anaconda for enterprise.</li>
                <li><a href="http://conda.pydata.org/miniconda.html">Miniconda</a> - lightweight version of Anaconda.</li>
                <li><a href="http://conda.pydata.org/docs/">Conda</a> - package and environment management system.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>To get started, download and install Anaconda from <a href="https://www.continuum.io/downloads">here</a>. I strongly recommend Python 3.x version as it is where the world is heading now.</p>

        <section>
            <h3>Jupyter Notebooks</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Comes together with Anaconda, to run simply type
                    <img src="img/cmd-jupyter-notebook.png" />
                    into the Anaconda console, being located in a folder where you want to store your notebooks.</li>
                <li>Up to IPython 3.X those were called IPython Notebooks and were monolithic part of IPython, but from IPython 4.0 language agnostic modules were separated from IPython, one of which became project <a href="http://jupyter.org/">Jupyter</a>. You can read about <a href="http://blog.jupyter.org/2015/04/15/the-big-split/">the big split here</a>.</li>
            </ul>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h3>The Big Split and Jupyter</h3>
            <p>Because of the big split, you will often find confusing information as some things changed significantly in the language agnostic projects compared to their counterparts in IPython 3.X, but also the knowledge is Googlable under IPython and new module name. It introduces some degree of chaos and it is good to be aware of that.</p>
            <p>Example of such change is integration of Jupyter Notebook with PySpark which because of absence of profiles in Jupyter compared to IPython must be implemented differently. But, overwelming amount of information relates profile-based solution.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h3>Jupyter and PySpark</h3>

            <p>Since, profile solution is unavailable in Jupyter, now the best approach to use PySpark with Python notebooks is to install <i>findspark</i> module via <i>conda</i> and use it to get to Spark Context.</p>

            <pre><code class="python">
    import findspark
    findspark.init()

    import pyspark
    sc = pyspark.SparkContext()
            </code></pre>

            <p>To install findspark, simply type <i>conda install findspark</i> into the Anaconda console.</p>

            <h3>Apache Hadoop</h3>
            <p>Apache Hadoop is an open-source software framework written in Java for distributed storage and distributed processing of very large data sets on computer clusters built from commodity hardware. All the modules in Hadoop are designed with a fundamental assumption that hardware failures are common and should be automatically handled by the framework.</p>
            <p>Based on <a href="http://research.google.com/archive/mapreduce.html">Map/Reduce paper</a> published by Google 10 years ahead of Hadoop development.</p>
            <p>Hadoop is not only Map/Reduce, but a big ecosystem with Hadoop core being: Hadoop Commons, Hadoop Distributed File System (HDFS), Hadoop YARN (resource management), and finally Hadoop MapReduce itself.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h3>Hadoop Ecosystem</h3>

        </section>

        <section>
            <h3>Apache Spark</h3>
            <p>Apache Spark is a fast and general engine for big data processing, with built-in modules for streaming, SQL, machine learning, and graph processing. It is written in Scala.</p>
            <p>The greatest difference from Hadoop is the ability to run iterative algorithms efficiently and manage caching and distribution of data. As most machine learning algorithms work like this Apache Spark opened many data science applications.</p>
            <p>Worth to note, that although we can write code in Python, but PySpark is only translating Python code to Scala, making it slower. <i>If you want to write optimised Spark code and use the latest features then you should write it in Scala.</i></p>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h3>Local Spark Instance</h3>

            <p>To launch Apache Spark locally add the following parameters to PySpark:</p>

            <pre><code class="bash">
                --master local[2] pyspark-shell
            </code></pre>

            <p>Conveniently, the parameters can also be stored in an environment variable <i>PYSPARK_SUBMIT_ARGS</i>.</p>
        </section>

        <!-- TODO: Spark libraries in more detail -->

        <section>
            <h3>Databases</h3>
            <p>Do not fall into a trap of underestimating databases. They are gems that were polished for many years.</p>
            <p>Even if you will not use database for data science, most likely, all data that you will need to integrate will come from databases. Sometimes data from as many as hundreds of databases with multitude of tables needs to be integrated before any analysis can be done.</p>
            <p>Databases are also good for data exploration, so it is good to know at least basics of most popular querying languages, e.g. one SQL dialect (relational), MongoDB (document-based), and Cypher (graph).</p>
            <p>... and with NoSQL revolution many databases are horizontally scalable such as Hadoop and Spark.</p>

                <li>Consider the level of support data science has organization-wide. Your success will depend on ability to present your findings and solutions to leadership.</li>
                <li>Make sure the organization (or team) has the funding and patience to see the fruits of your labor – it won’t happen overnight.</li>
                <li>Be realistic about start-ups. Very few startups become profitable, let alone reach the success of Facebook or Uber, and most fail within a few years.</li>

            <ul>
                <li>Build your business knowledge. . The number one complaint we hear from companies about data scientists is that they lack business knowledge and skills. Your analysis must be relevant to company business goals.</li>
                <li>Develop your communication skills. Presenting findings to a non-technical audience (such as the marketing team or the C-Suite) is a crucial part of being a data scientist. Presenting your findings can be very challenging, so develop your storytelling skills.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Process</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Data integration - pull data from many data management systems, resolve any incosistencies (e.g., missing values, different timezones), and reshape.</li>
                <li>Data exploration - explore and visualize data. Get intuition about it and observe patterns.</li>
                <li>Solution development - develop and implement algorithm solving your problem.</li>
                <li>Knowledge management - if you need to manage user privileges or privacy</li>
                <li>DS product ownership - make results available to non data scientists (e.g. analysis runnable from Django website)</li>

            <h2>Data integration</h2>
            <p>Goal of data integration is to bring all data from different systems in different formats into one data
            set that can be analysed.</p>
            <p>Example, you come there 100 different databases, in different time zone formats, with some values missing
            etc.</p>

            <h3>80/20 rule of data science</h3>
            <p>You spend 80% of time on data preparation and only 20% on the analysis.</p>
            <p>Data integration is not the best use of data scientist time,
                but unfortunately this often is the reality.</p>
            <p>This problem can be solved by either:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>data integration specialist who will handle this side of a problem or/and</li>
                <li>a specialised platform.</li>
            </ul>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h3>Data integration specialist</h3>
            <p>This is a person that will come from the company to which you work as contractor preparing the data for
                you to work with or at least giving the guide over the available data and working with you explaining
                what it means and resolving any problems.</p>

            <h3>Precision/accuracy/generalisation tradeoff</h3>
            Also need to take time constraints into account
            Less accurate data delivered quickly may be of greater business value than very accurate delivered too late

            <h3>Popcorn method</h3>
            <blockquote>
                You stare at the data (possibly eating popcorn) until something pops up.
            </blockquote>
            This approach may sounds stunning, but with data science a lot of things come with experience and domain knowledge.

        <section>
            <h3>Data preparation</h3>
            <p>When beginning to work with data you should ask yourself 3 questions:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>What data do I have?</li>
                <li>What data do I need?</li>
                <li>What is the most evil thing I can do with data?</li>

            <h3>What is the most evil thing I can do with data?</h3>
            <p>Not really evil, but helps to think about possibilities, really spark the discussion, but also helps to
            think about what protections need to be put in the place.</p>

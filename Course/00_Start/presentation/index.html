            <ul>
                <li>50% of data has IP address (is connected to each other)!</li>
                <li>By 2020, almost all data will be connected.</li>
                <li>The abundance and ubiquitousness of data changes business intelligence models (e.g. think
                    Encyclopedia Britannica rendered obsolete by Wikipedia).
                </li>
                <li>We literally have a whole world in our pocket.</li>
                <li>We no longer choose to be connected, but not to be.</li>
                <li>Some companies accumulated lots of data over years, in a sense they sit on a pile of gold.</li>
                <li><i>Data is our most valuable natural resource.</i></li>
                <li><i>But, we need to be able to connect the dots.</i></li>

            <h3>Who is a data scientist?</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Business Analyst - to understand the data and problem, prioritize, what is a measure of success, etc.</li>
                <li>Statistician - to be able to model the data, confidence level, back test it, etc.</li>
                <li>Software Engineering - to be able to implement advanced algorithms, perform complex computations, and create a data product.</li>
            </ul>

            <p>As the word is "sexy" there are people who like to borrow the term, e.g. a person just running lots of Map/Reduce Hadoop jobs is not (necessarily) a data scientist.</p>

            <h3>Who is a data scientist?</h3>
            <blockquote>
                [..] a data scientist is a predictive analytics professional who uses statistics and
                predictive modeling to solve business problems, and who has experience with tools for organizing
                unstructured, often streaming Big Data. They can work with a wide variety of data, as they have the
                skills to build their own utilities to acquire and clean it, and don’t rely on out-of-the-box solutions to
                structure their data.

            <p>There is no one single type of data science. It can mean different things for different people.</p>
            <p>Also there are people who call themselves data scientist even if they are not, e.g. Hadoop developer.</p>
            <p>This differences find its way into taxonomy and literature, so watch out for those.
            But, generally they are similar enough to not cause any confusion. Just be aware of it.</p>

            <h3>Where data scientists work?</h3>
            You may be surprised where data science innovation awaits - big companies rather than start-ups
            The reasons are that big companies often sit on a big pile of data, while start-ups do not have resources to
            spend on that.

                Although “Big Data” may have been the hot topic last year, this year data science has been
                permeating the discussion in every board room across the country. Nearly every company wants to
                know more about data scientists: Who are they? What do they do? How do we get one? This
                report endeavors to answer many of those burning questions, including perhaps the most burning

            <h3>Advice for Data Scientists by Burtch Works</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Plan your career carefully. Evaluate how can you learn, grow skill set, and position yourself to achieve long-term goals.</li>
                <li>Consider the level of support data science has organization-wide. Your success will depend on ability to present your findings and solutions to leadership.</li>
                <li>Make sure the organization (or team) has the funding and patience to see the fruits of
                    your labor – it won’t happen overnight.</li>
                <li>Be realistic about start-ups. Very few startups become profitable, let alone reach the
                    success of Facebook or Uber, and most fail within a few years.</li>
                <li>Build your business knowledge. . The number one complaint we hear from companies about
                    data scientists is that they lack business knowledge and skills. Your analysis must be relevant to company business goals.</li>
                <li>Develop your communication skills. Presenting findings to a non-technical audience (such
                    as the marketing team or the C-Suite) is a crucial part of being a data scientist. Presenting your findings can be very challenging,
                    so develop your storytelling skills.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Data integration</h2>
            <p>Goal of data integration is to bring all data from different systems in different formats into one data
            set that can be analysed.</p>
            <p>Example, you come there 100 different databases, in different time zone formats, with some values missing

            <h3>80/20 rule of data science</h3>
            <p>You spend 80% of time on data preparation and only 20% on the analysis.</p>
            <p>Data integration is not the best use of data scientist time,
                but unfortunately this often is the reality.</p>
            <p>This problem can be solved by either:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>data integration specialist who will handle this side of a problem or/and</li>
                <li>a specialised platform.</li>

            <h3>Data integration specialist</h3>
            <p>This is a person that will come from the company to which you work as contractor preparing the data for
                you to work with or at least giving the guide over the available data and working with you explaining

                <li>What data do I have?</li>

            libraries and frameworks allowing us to concentrate on the problem at hand.

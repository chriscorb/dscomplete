                Making Open and Machine Readable the New Default for Government Information.

            <ul>
                <li>50% of data has IP address (in other words is online)!</li>
                <li>By 2020, almost all data will be connected.</li>
                <li>The abundance and ubiquitousness of data changes business intelligence models (e.g. think
                    Encyclopedia Britannica rendered obsolete by Wikipedia).
                </li>
                <li>We literally have a whole world in our pocket.</li>
                <li>We no longer choose to be connected, but not to be.</li>
                <li>Some companies accumulated lots of data over years, in a sense they sit on a pile of gold.</li>
                <li><i>Data is our most valuable natural resource.</i></li>
                <li><i>But, we need to be able to connect the dots.</i></li>

            <p>How data scientist title come to be:</p>
            <blockquote style="font-size: .75em;">
                “Business analyst” seemed too limiting. “Data analyst” was a contender, but we felt that title might
                limit what people could do. After all, many of the people on our teams had deep engineering expertise.
                “Research scientist” was a reasonable job title used by companies like Sun, HP, Xerox, Yahoo, and IBM.
                However, we felt that most research scientists worked on projects that were futuristic and abstract,
                and the work was done in labs that were isolated from the product development teams. It might take years
                for lab research to affect key products, if it ever did. Instead, the focus of our teams was to work on
                data applications that would have an immediate and massive impact on the business. The term that seemed
                to fit best was <i>data scientist: those who use both data and science to create something new</i>.

            <blockquote>
                [..] a data scientist is a predictive analytics professional who uses statistics and
                predictive modeling to solve business problems, and who has experience with tools for organizing
                unstructured, often streaming Big Data. They can work with a wide variety of data, as they have the
                skills to build their own utilities to acquire and clean it, and don’t rely on out-of-the-box solutions to
                structure their data.

            <blockquote style="width: 100%; font-size: .7em;">
                One salutary incident that I recall concerned a British mathematical physicist and an American
                theoretical physicist, Dr. Charles Kittel, who had been set together, side by side, to work on
                the problem of deducing the characteristics of German magnetic mines laid at sea, especially
                the sensitivity and polarity of the firing mechanism. The data from which the characteristics were
                to be deduced were the reports of our minesweepers as they exploded the mines, with the positions of
                the explosions being reported as ranges and bearings from the minesweepers. The first thing that Kittel
                wanted to do was to take a few trips on a minesweeper to sample the data for himself. The British
                theorist refused to do this, on the argument that he could only make a few trips, and therefore any
                experience so gained might be heavily biased, and therefore much too dangerous as a basis for
                generalization. So he stuck to his desk while Kittel went out minesweeping. What Kittel immediately
                found was that the reports from the minesweeping crews were wildly inaccurate as regards both range and
                bearing, and the only item of data on which one could rely was whether the mine had exploded to port or
                starboard. Simplifying all the later reports down to this extremely limited observation, he nevertheless
                succeeded in deducing the answer; but the British theorist went on accepting the data as accurate and
                never reached an answer.

This judgment certainly seemed reasonable, since the planes themselves seldom malfunctioned. [..] piloting skills were not the cause of the problem. If it wasn't human or mechanical error, what was it? [..] officials turned their attention to the design of the cockpit itself. [..] when the army was designing its first-ever cockpit, engineers had measured the physical dimensions of hundreds of pilots, and used this data to standardize the dimensions of the cockpit. [..]  In 1950, [..] measured more than 4,000 pilots on 140 dimensions of size [..] and calculated the average for each of these dimensions. [..] the consensus among fellow air force researchers was that the vast majority of pilots would be within the average range on most dimensions. After all, these pilots had already been pre-selected because they appeared to be average sized. [..] The scientists also expected that a sizable number of pilots would be within the average range on all 10 dimensions. But even Daniels was stunned when he tabulated the actual number.

            <p>Statistical graphics are instruments to help people reason about quantitive information.</p>
            <p>Often the most effective way to describe, explore, and summarize a set of numbers - even a very large set - is to look at pictures of those numbers.</p>
            <p>Of all methods for analyzing and communicating statistical information, well-designed data graphics are usually the simplest and at the same time the most powerful.</p>
            <p>Human eye have amazing ability to extract a lot of information from a small area (example on the next slide).</p>
            <p>So, how to visualize statistical information?</p>

            <p>Graphics need to make data clearer. Shape data to lead observer to conclusion.</p>

            $$
            \begin{equation}
            \begin{split}
            \mbox{lie factor} &= \frac{\mbox{size of effect shown in graphic}}{\mbox{size of effect in data}}
            \end{split}
            \end{equation}
            $$

            <p>Lie factor within $ [0.95, 1.05] $ is acceptable, beyond that means that data is misleading.</p>

            <p>Can also define $ log LF $, where $ log LF < 0 $ means that data is underrepresented  and $ log LF > 0 $ means that is overrepresented.</p>

            <p>Dimensionality expansion (e.g. showing stock price of crude oil in 3D barrels: 1D -> 3D) leads to $ LF $ explosion due to power factor.</p>

            <h4>$ LF $ of $ 9.4 $</h4>

            <p>Here, the problem is too strong emphasis on design variation, without regard for reflecting the actual data variation.</p>

            <p>The confounding of design variation with data variation over the surface of graphic leads to ambiguity and deception.</p>

            <p>Reflect data dimensionality and do not inflate the dimensions (design dimensionality should be less or same as data dimensionality).</p>

            <i>Show data variation, not design variation</i>

            <p>However, it generally is a good idea to introduce other design variation (e.g. depth, shade, number instead of point, etc.) to represent data dimensions with less design dimensions.</p>

            <p>Money value changes over time with inflation, but also can be influenced by factors such as time-value of money. Simply plotting nominal value over time is going to lead to terribly bad conclusions.</p>

            A large share of ink on a graphic should present data-information, the ink chaning as the data change. <i>Data-ink</i> is the non-erasable core of a graphic, the non-redundant ink arrange in response to variation in the numbers represented.

            Data-ink ratio = data-ink / total ink used to print the graphic
            = proprition of graphic's ink devoted to non-redundant display of data-information
            = 1.0 - proprotion of a graphic that can be erased without loss of data-information.

            Grids have no place in graphs. Only exception when one need to follow data, but then it needs to be less visible than data. Can be replaced with labels, etc.

            <h3>Some ink saving can be found where you do not expect them</h3>
            Example, symmetry. When analyzing faces, wazes, etc., people examine only one side and if other is symmetric then once they quickly find it they stop analysing it. So, we can save half-the-ink by dividing along the symmetry. Also if we have asymetry then we can easily indicate it by displaying the whole.

            The maps repay careful study. Notice how quickly and naturally our attention has been directed toward exploring the substantive content of the data rather than toward questions of methodology and technique.

            John Snow's map lead to removal of water pump handle that was spreading Cholera and in the result saving hundreds of lives.

            <h3>Time-series</h3>
            The most frequently used form of graphic design (about 75%).
            <blockquote>
                With one dimension marching along the regular rhythm of seconds, minutes, hours, days, weeks, months, years, centuries, or millennia, the natural ordering of the time scale gives this design a strength and efficiency o interpretation found in no other graphic arrangement.
            </blockquote>
            Best for big data sets with real variabiliy.

            Small, noncomparative, highly labeled data sets usually belong in tabels.

            <h4>Birth of Machine Intelligence</h4>
            Computers are learning to think, read, and write. They’re also picking up human sensory function, with the ability to see and hear (arguably to touch, taste, and smell, though those have been of a lesser focus). Machine intelligence technologies cut across a vast array of problem types (from classification and clustering to natural language processing and computer vision) and methods (from support vector machines to deep belief networks). All of these technologies are reflected on this landscape.
            This doesn't include big data
            Selected from a list of 2,529 companies.

            The giants in search (Google, Baidu), social networks (Facebook, LinkedIn, Pinterest), content (Netflix, Yahoo!), mobile (Apple) and e-commerce (Amazon) are in an incredible position. They have massive datasets and constant consumer interactions that enable tight feedback loops for their algorithms (and these factors combine to create powerful network effects) — and they have the most to gain from the low hanging fruit that machine intelligence bears.

            big corpo - access to godfathers and great data sets

            Big companies have an inherent advantage and it’s likely that the ones who will win the machine intelligence race will be even more powerful than they are today. However, the good news for the rest of the world is that the core technology they develop will rapidly spill into other areas, both via departing talent and published research.
            Similar to the big data revolution, which was sparked by the release of Google’s BigTable and BigQuery papers, we will see corporations release equally groundbreaking new technologies into the community. Those innovations will be adapted to new industries and use cases that the Googles of the world don’t have the DNA or desire to tackle.

            Opportunities for entrepreneurs:

            https://github.com/Bloomberg-Beta/Manual

            Machine intelligence already helps us get the important business information we need more quickly, monitors critical systems, feeds our population more efficiently, reduces the cost of health care, detects disease earlier, and so on.

            Perhaps you heard recently about a new algorithm that can drive a car? Or invent a recipe? Or scan a picture and find your face in a crowd?  It seems as though every week companies are finding new uses for algorithms that adapt as they encounter new data. Last year Wired quoted an ex-Google employee as saying that “Everything in the company is really driven by machine learning.”

            Machine learning has tremendous potential to transform companies, but in practice it’s mostly far more mundane than robot drivers and chefs. Think of it simply as a branch of statistics, designed for a world of big data. Executives who want to get the most out of their companies’ data should understand what it is, what it can do, and what to watch out for when using it.

            Not just big data, but wide data

            Predictions, not causality

            The most common application of machine learning tools is to make predictions. Here are a few examples of prediction problems in a business:

            Making personalized recommendations for customers
            Forecasting long-term customer loyalty
            Anticipating the future performance of employees
            Rating the credit risk of loan applicants
            These settings share some common features. For one, they are all complex environments, where the right decision might depend on a lot of variables (which means they require “wide” data). They also have some outcome to validate the results of a prediction – like whether someone clicks on a recommended item, or whether a customer buys again. Finally, there is an important business decision to be made that requires an accurate prediction.

            Separating the signal from the noise

            Steps:

            Mistakes to avoid

            Confusing prediction and casual model

            well trained algorithm should make good predictions for environment it seen
            so the more stable our environment the more valuable our predictions
            if we move algorithm to new environment we may not get good predictions
            it is one of human biases - we try to find patterns and casuation everywhere
            e.g. e-commerce data for kilt store, may not be so useful for brick-and-mortar store even if both sell similar product

                Although “Big Data” may have been the hot topic last year, this year data science has been
                permeating the discussion in every board room across the country. Nearly every company wants to
                know more about data scientists: Who are they? What do they do? How do we get one? This
                report endeavors to answer many of those burning questions, including perhaps the most burning
                question of all: What do they earn?

            <h3>Where DS work? It may surprise you.</h3>
            You may be surprised where data science innovation awaits - big companies rather than start-ups
            The reasons are that big companies often sit on a big pile of data, while start-ups do not have resources to
            spend on that.

            <h3>Advice for Data Scientists by Burtch Works</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Plan your career carefully. Evaluate how can you learn, grow skill set, and position yourself to achieve long-term goals.</li>
                <li>Consider the level of support data science has organization-wide. Your success will depend on ability to present your findings and solutions to leadership.</li>
                <li>Make sure the organization (or team) has the funding and patience to see the fruits of
                    your labor – it won’t happen overnight.</li>
                <li>Be realistic about start-ups. Very few startups become profitable, let alone reach the
                    success of Facebook or Uber, and most fail within a few years.</li>
                <li>Build your business knowledge. . The number one complaint we hear from companies about
                    data scientists is that they lack business knowledge and skills. Your analysis must be relevant to company business goals.</li>
                <li>Develop your communication skills. Presenting findings to a non-technical audience (such
                    as the marketing team or the C-Suite) is a crucial part of being a data scientist. Presenting your findings can be very challenging,
                    so develop your storytelling skills.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Process</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Data integration - pull data from many data management systems, resolve any incosistencies (e.g., missing values, different timezones), and reshape.</li>
                <li>Data exploration - explore and visualize data. Get intuition about it and observe patterns.</li>
                <li>Solution development - develop and implement algorithm solving your problem.</li>
                <li>Knowledge management - if you need to manage user privileges or privacy</li>
                <li>DS product ownership - make results available to non data scientists (e.g. analysis runnable from Django website)</li>

            <h2>Data integration</h2>
            <p>Goal of data integration is to bring all data from different systems in different formats into one data
            set that can be analysed.</p>
            <p>Example, you come there 100 different databases, in different time zone formats, with some values missing
            etc.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h3>80/20 rule of data science</h3>
            <p>You spend 80% of time on data preparation and only 20% on the analysis.</p>
            <p>Data integration is not the best use of data scientist time,
                but unfortunately this often is the reality.</p>
            <p>This problem can be solved by either:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>data integration specialist who will handle this side of a problem or/and</li>
                <li>a specialised platform.</li>
            </ul>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h3>Data integration specialist</h3>
            <p>This is a person that will come from the company to which you work as contractor preparing the data for
                you to work with or at least giving the guide over the available data and working with you explaining
                what it means and resolving any problems.</p>

            <h3>Precision/accuracy/generalisation tradeoff</h3>
            Also need to take time constraints into account
            Less accurate data delivered quickly may be of greater business value than very accurate delivered too late
            Balancing with other priorities

            <h3>Popcorn method</h3>
            <blockquote>
                You stare at the data (possibly eating popcorn) until something pops up.
            </blockquote>
            This approach may sounds stunning, but with data science a lot of things come with experience and domain knowledge.
        </section>

        <section>
            <h3>Data preparation</h3>
            <p>When beginning to work with data you should ask yourself 3 questions:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>What data do I have?</li>
                <li>What data do I need?</li>
                <li>What is the most evil thing I can do with data?</li>

        <section>
            <h3>What is the most evil thing I can do with data?</h3>
            <p>Not really evil, but helps to think about possibilities, really spark the discussion, but also helps to
            think about what protections need to be put in the place.</p>
